A simple design-patterns quiz and review app.

Design pattern descriptions are stored in the ./patterns directory as text files
with a filename format of <pattern-name>.pattern. Each .pattern file contains:

  - The pattern's name
  - The pattern's description
  - A diagram of the pattern's objects and their relationships

Run the app to review patterns or quiz yourself.
